# Static writing links

This is just a list of some links to articles I have written. 

It is not anywhere near being exhaustive, but unlike sites' internal portfolio pages, it covers more than one source.

That could be useful for scraping or such at some future time. 

(It's not JSON, of course, but it should be pretty easy to parse/convert if needed.)
